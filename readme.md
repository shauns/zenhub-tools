# zenhub-tools

`node index.js` will give you a breakdown of the per pipeline stats for your current milestone

## Set-up

You'll need some environment variables - a `.env` file is good.

```
GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
ZENHUB_TOKEN="..."
GITHUB_MASTER_OWNER="YourOrganisation"
GITHUB_MASTER_REPO="your-repo"
ZENHUB_CURRENT_MILESTONE="milestone-title"
```
